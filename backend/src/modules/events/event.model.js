     * thought about money yet are the same thing to a member pressing Register.
     *
     * A fee turns registration into two steps rather than one — see
     * `EventService.register`: the seat is held with a pending payment and only
     * becomes a confirmed registration once that payment settles. It is stored
     * on the EVENT and copied onto each registration at the moment it is taken,

     * already paid.

     * WHAT A MEMBER PAYS INSTEAD — the membership discount, as a price.
     *
     * `registrationFee` is the common price: it is what a visitor off the
     * onboarding site pays, and what a signed-in member with no active
     * membership pays. This is the rate reserved for members who HAVE paid
     * their membership, and it is the reason a member's subscription visibly
     * earns them something on a screen a non-member is also looking at.
     *
     * STORED AS THE MEMBER'S PRICE, NOT AS A SAVING. "Discount: 1000" against
     * "Price: 1000" reads two ways — a free seat for members, or no discount at
     * all — and the two readings differ by the entire ticket price. A price has
     * exactly one reading, so the editor types the number that will be charged
     * and the screens compute the saving from the pair. The form still calls it
     * the member price and prints "Members save ₹400 (40% off)" beneath it, so
     * nobody has to hold this distinction in their head.
     *
     * `null`, NOT `0`, IS THE DEFAULT AND IT MEANS "NO MEMBER RATE".
     *
     * Zero cannot stand in for "unset" here the way it does for
     * `registrationFee`. Zero is a real and useful answer — a ₹1,000 conference
     * that members attend free is the strongest version of this offer — so a
     * scheme where 0 meant "charge them the full price" would make the best
     * offer the association can make unexpressible. Every event already in the
     * collection comes back `null` and charges one price to everybody, exactly
     * as it does today.
     *
     * A value ABOVE `registrationFee` is not rejected by the schema and is not
     * meaningful; `memberPriceFor()` in the service takes the lower of the two,
     * so a fat-fingered member rate can never charge a member MORE than the
     * public price.

     * The registration form, as the super admin designed it (EVT-004).
     *
     * Every event asks something different. A conclave needs a delegate
     * category and a dietary preference; a factory visit needs a vehicle
     * number and an ID proof; a training day needs a T-shirt size. Hard-coding
     * a union of every field any event might want produces a form that is
     * mostly irrelevant to every event, which members then fill in wrongly.
     *
     * So the form is DATA. The super admin builds it per event and the member
     * screen renders whatever it finds — no client-side list of known fields,
     * because a client that knows the fields is a client that has to ship
     * before a new one can be asked for.
     *
     * FOUR STANDING FIELDS ARE NOT IN HERE: name, phone, organisation and the
     * note. They are columns on the registration itself, the attendee list has
     * headings for them, and the reminder and contact flows read them by name.
     * They are what running an event requires; everything else is what THIS
     * event requires, and that is what this list holds.
     *
     * `key` is the stable identifier an answer is stored against and is never
     * regenerated from the label. Renaming "T-shirt size" to "Shirt size" after
     * forty people have registered must not orphan forty answers.
