/**
 * Public event bookings — "Book Now", guest checkout, several participants.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * THE PRICE IS THE EVENT'S, AND THE TOTAL IS THIS SERVER'S ARITHMETIC
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * A client sends an event id and a number of people. It never sends an amount,
 * a unit price or a total, and none is read from the request even if one is
 * present. `resolveEvent` reads `registrationFee` off the event and
 * `priceBooking` multiplies. This is the same rule the membership path carries
 * in capitals — the price SHOWN and the price CHARGED must be one lookup — and
 * it matters more here, because this endpoint is unauthenticated: a total
 * accepted from an anonymous browser is a price chosen by the buyer.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * WHAT MAY BE BOOKED IS DECIDED BY THE EXISTING VISIBILITY RULES
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * `resolveEvent` does not own a rule about who may book what. It asks whichever
 * authority already decides what that caller may SEE — `cms.service.listEvent`
 * for a guest, `event.service.getEvent` for a signed-in member — because
 * "bookable" and "readable" are the same question and a second answer to it
 * would drift from the first. CLAUDE.md names that exact failure: an event
 * vanishing from one surface and staying reachable at a URL somebody copied.
 *
 * That split matters in both directions. A guest must not book a members-only
 * event; a MEMBER must be able to book a region-targeted one that was never
 * opted on to the public site — which is most of the programme, and which the
 * public rule alone answered "Event not found" for while the member was
 * standing on its page.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * NOTHING HERE TRUSTS THE CALLER, BECAUSE THERE IS NO CALLER
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * Every other write path in this codebase sits behind `verifyToken`. This one
 * cannot — a guest has no account, and requiring one is the whole thing the
 * client asked to remove. So the guards are all here: the event must be
 * bookable, the seats must exist, the participant list is rebuilt from
 * `noOfPersons` rather than trusted at the length the client sent, and every
 * name, email and mobile is validated and normalised before it is written.

     * collection — joined in memory. The seat arithmetic itself is deliberately
     * identical to `countSeats`: `active` bookings that are settled or still
     * inside a live hold, plus non-pending member registrations. Two different
     * ideas of what fills a chair is how an event shows 100 seats left on one
     * screen and 83 on another.
     *
     * BOTH COLLECTIONS, for the reason `seatsFor` gives: a member's own seat and
     * a participant on a public booking are the same chair in the same room.
     *
     * `capacity: 0` means unlimited, which the schema's note explains. It is
     * reported as `null` remaining rather than as a negative or a zero — a
     * table cell reading "0 remaining" on an uncapped event would stop an
     * organiser taking bookings they can perfectly well take.

     * A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM `listBookings`, which is why it is a different
     * method rather than a flag. A booking is a transaction: who paid, how
     * much, by what means. This is the room: who is actually walking in. One
     * booking for four colleagues is one row there and four rows here, and on
     * the door only the second shape is any use — an organiser ticking people
     * off a list needs the name of the person standing in front of them, and
     * that person may be none of the three whose name is on the payment.
     *
     * THE BOOKER IS INCLUDED ONLY IF THEY ARE ALSO A PARTICIPANT. An office
     * manager who books four seats and does not attend is not in the room, and
     * putting them on the door list would have somebody turned away for a seat
     * that was never theirs. `bookedBy` is carried on every row as context —
     * who to ask about this seat — rather than as a row of its own.
     *
     * ONLY PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY NAMED ARE LISTED. A booking for four where
     * one name was typed produces ONE row, not four.
     *
     * It used to produce four, the unnamed three reading "Guest 2 of 4" - a
     * person the organiser had no record of, invented by this function so the
     * row count would match the seat count. The seat count is reported as a
     * number (`seatsBooked`), which is what it is; a seat is not a person until
     * somebody says who is sitting in it.
