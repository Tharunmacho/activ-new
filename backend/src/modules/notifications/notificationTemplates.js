 * at its own call site they drift: the notification says the district has it,
 * the email says the block does, and the member has no way to tell which is
 * current. Everything a channel needs for an event is declared here once, and
 * `notification.service.dispatchLifecycleEvent` renders all three from it.
 *
 * WHATSAPP TEMPLATES ARE NOT WRITTEN HERE — they are written on the BotBee
 * dashboard and approved by Meta, and what this file holds is the NAME of the
 * approved template plus the ordered list of variables it takes. The body text
 * below it is the fallback used inside an open 24-hour session window (a reply
 * to the bot) and by mock mode. Sending a template that has not been approved
 * under that exact name is rejected by the provider, so the names here have to
 * match the dashboard exactly; they are listed in the setup notes.

 *     bare `"1"`, `"#1#"`, `data`, `template_variable`. One message carried a
 *     different marker under every key at once; it rendered `-`.
 *   - Subscriber custom fields, written every way `/subscriber/update` accepts.
 *     It answers success and `/subscriber/get` reads back `custom_fields: null`.
 *   - `first_name`, a SYSTEM field, set and CONFIRMED STORED on the subscriber,
 *     then sent with no values in the payload at all. Still `-`.
 *   - Templates bound to `#1#` and to `#first_name#`, both.
 *   - The dashboard's Sync Templates action, and registering the variables under
 *     Message Templates -> Variables. Neither changed the delivered message.
 *
 * So a variable in a body sent through BotBee is not a personalisation. It is a
 * guaranteed dash in a real member's chat, on the first message ACTIV ever sends
 * them, behind an HTTP 200 and a green row on the oversight screen.
 *
 * WHERE THE MEMBER'S NAME COMES FROM MEANWHILE. The `text` on each event above,
 * composed here in JavaScript with the values already interpolated, which BotBee
 * never parses and so cannot break. It is legal only inside the 24-hour window a
 * member's own message opens — which is exactly why every variable-free body
 * below asks for a word back. The reply opens the window, the keyword bot
 * answers with the member's real details, and the gap narrows to one tap.
 *
 * SWITCHING BACK COSTS NOTHING IN CODE. `botbee.service` reads each template's
 * `variable_map` off the account at send time and sends exactly the values that
 * template declares — none for a variable-free body, three for a three-slot one.
 * So restoring `bodyWithVariables` on the dashboard is the WHOLE change: no
 * deploy, no restart, no edit here. `metaCloud.service` fills them properly.
 *
 * CATEGORY IS UTILITY, NOT MARKETING. These are transactional. Utility is
 * cheaper, is not suppressed by marketing preferences on the handset, and is the
 * category Meta expects. The four on the account were created as Marketing.
 *
 * `scripts/test-notifications.js --templates` prints both versions.

 * a template still in review means the member is told NOTHING on WhatsApp, and

 * who, what happened, what next. A payment reminder rendered through it reads
 * "Hello Rajeshwari, your ACTIV membership application is now Payment pending.
 * Complete Rs 10,000 to activate your membership." — less precisely worded than
